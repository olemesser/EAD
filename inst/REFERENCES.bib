abstract = { This paper examines the effect of product variety on manufacturing performance, defined here as total labor productivity and consumer-perceived product quality. Using data from the International Motor Vehicle Program (M.I.T.) study of 70 assembly plants worldwide, the paper examines three dimensions of product variety, at fundamental, peripheral, and intermediate levels. The international sample reveals great variation in the distribution of each type of product variety in different regions, reflecting in part different strategies for variety. Furthermore, the impact of different kinds of product variety on performance varies, and is generally much less than the conventional manufacturing wisdom would predict. However, an intermediate type of product variety, here called parts complexity, was found to have a persistent negative impact on productivity. Finally, the study provides partial support for the hypothesis that management policies, in both operations and human resource areas, can facilitate the absorption of higher levels of product variety, i.e. that “lean production” plants are capable of handling higher levels of product variety with less adverse effect on total labor productivity than traditional “mass production” plants. }

As with laboratory and field experiments, researchers must decide on the independent variables and their levels, the experimental design, and the dependent variables. Options for dependent and independent variables are ample, as are ways to model the relations among these variables. We provide a modular framework that provides structure to these variables, their definitions, and the modeling of connections among them. Further, we offer insights into the design and layout of output data files to facilitate data analysis. We also present tips on how to report the results from such numerical experiments effectively. Finally, we provide C# source code for many of these modules in an online appendix.

Our study seeks a tool that enables product managers to estimate the cost of introducing variety into their product line. This will help them to maximize market coverage while maintaining required profit margins. Variety incurs many indirect costs that are not always well understood or are difficult to capture. These costs are often not considered by people making the decision about introducing variety. Our DFV model attempts to capture these indirect costs through the measurement of three indices: commonality, differentiation point, and set-up cost. These indices will allow the decision makers to estimate some of the generally unmeasurable costs of providing variety. We conclude this paper by discussing our validation plans for testing the model in industry.}",

abstract = {Complexity is a significant concern to managers and can undermine operational performance if not managed well, or if managed well could be used to strategic advantage. However, the quantification of complexity is requisite to managing and exploiting it. To date, an easily employable quantitative measure has not been introduced. This has hampered the ability of researchers to conduct large empirical studies and to gain a fuller understanding of the impacts of complexity on organizations. This has in turn impeded the ability of researchers to inform managers about how to manage complexity. This article presents one such measure, the Generalized Complexity Index (GCI), and illustrates it using publicly available data from the cruise line industry. The GCI employs the product structure diagram to create a geometric structure from which the level of the three dimensions of complexity (multiplicity, diversity, and interconnectedness) can be computed. The GCI is a function of these three dimensions. A significant advantage of the GCI is that it can be applied at multiple levels of analysis including product, portfolio, and supply chain. Implications for business diversification research and marketing strategy are introduced and future research topics are identified.}

doi = {10.1287/mnsc.1100.1293},
abstract = { The academic and practitioner literature justifies firms' use of product costs in product pricing and capacity planning decisions as heuristics to address an otherwise intractable problem. However, product costs are the output of a cost reporting system, which itself is the outcome of heuristic design choices. In particular, because of informational limitations, when designing cost systems firms use simple rules of thumb to group resources into cost pools and to select drivers used to allocate the pooled costs to products. Using simulations, we examine how popular choices in costing system design influence the error in reported costs. Taking information needs into account, we offer alternative ways to translate the vague guidance in the literature to implementable methods. Specifically, we compare size-based rules for forming cost pools with more informationally demanding correlation-based rules and develop a blended method that performs well in terms of accuracy. In addition, our analysis suggests that significant gains can be made from using a composite driver rather than selecting a driver based on the consumption pattern for the largest resource only, especially when combined with correlation-based rules to group resources. We vary properties of the underlying cost structure (such as the skewness in resource costs, the traceability of resources to products, the sharing of resources across products, and the variance in resource consumption patterns) to address the generalizability of our findings and to show when different heuristics might be preferred.

abstract = { The main task of outlier detection is to detect data objects which have a different mechanism from the conventional data set. The existing outlier detection methods are mainly divided into two directions: local outliers and global outliers. Aiming at the limitations of the existing outlier detection methods, we propose a novel outlier detection algorithm which is named as kNN-LOF. First, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm is applied to divide different areas for outlier attributes, which is more suitable for outlier detection in different density distributions. Secondly, a hierarchical adjacency order is proposed to hierarchize the neighborhood range according to the link distance. The average sequence distance is calculated from the data objects in the hierarchy, and the reachable distance of an object is redefined to introduce a new local outlier factor. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has good performance in improving the accuracy of outlier detection. }

These companies regularly add new product variations to the family in order to meet changing market needs or to attract a broader customer base. Although the core functionality remains essentially unchanged across the products within a family, new functions, feature combinations and technologies are incorporated into each new product. If allowed to grow unchecked, these component variations, commonly referred to as “complexity”, can result in a loss of productivity or quality. The challenge lies in an effective management of product variations in the design studio and on the manufacturing floor. The key is to minimize non-value added variations across models within a product family without limiting customer choices. In this paper we discuss the factors that contribute to product complexity in general, and present an objective measure, called the Product Line Commonality Index, to capture the level of component commonality in a product family. Through our Walkman case study, we present a simple yet powerful method of benchmarking product families1. This method gauges the family’s ability to share parts effectively (modularity) and to reduce the total number of parts (multi-functionality). [S1050-0472(00)02704-5]}",

Regression analysis indicates that two of the seven forms of heterogeneity are costly: differences in processing efficiency and in customer-specified quality requirements.

Cost-effectiveness has never lost relevance as a competitive advantage because firms' competition against best-cost countries as well as product variety from customers' power have been continuously increasing over the last years. The thesis hence develops a theory-connecting framework called `extended axiomatic design' (EAD) that integrates engineering design and economic firm theory and thereby composes an extensive formalization of product programs. Using the EAD for modeling and simulating allows examining modularization strategies in terms of costs, effective choices of cost system designs, and the impact of random measurement errors on cost-based decision-making. Overall, this thesis devotes to the development and understanding of cost-effectiveness in firms by examining cost measurement and management.},
